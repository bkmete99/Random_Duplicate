# Random_Duplicate
Alghoritm that trys to find duplicate number in a determined interval in an array with full of random numbers that interval by choosen by user
Problem Description
Let A[1..n] be an array of n numbers. If i<j and A[i]=A[j], then the pair (i,j) is called a duplication of A.
Suppose that the elements of A are filled in by a uniform random number generator that produces numbers in the range [1..n] (i.e., 1 ≤ A[i] ≤ n for i =1 to n).

Write a C++ program that a. takes number of array elements (n) from the command line. b. fills in the array with random numbers from the range [1..n]. c. outputs array elements (for clarity, output up to 10 array elements per line). d. outputs expected number of duplications, based on your analysis in Part (a). e. finds all the duplications of the array and prints them out. f. outputs encountered number of duplications, based on the program run

EXAMPLE PROGRAM RUN

Array
9       9       9       4       6       5       4       14      7       2
1       11      3       5
EXPECTED NUMBER OF DUPLICATIONS = 6.5
(1,2)(1,3)(2,3)(4,7)(6,14)
ENCOUNTERED NUMBER OF DUPLICATIONS =  5

IN MY PROGRAMS I USED TWO DISTINCT APPROACH
